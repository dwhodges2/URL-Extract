</strong></div>
<div>
<div><strong>Michael J. Green (2017)</strong></div>
</div>
<div>
<div>Soon after the American      Revolution, certain of the founders began to recognize the strategic      significance of Asia and the Pacific and the vast material and cultural      resources at stake there. Over the coming generations, the United States      continued to ask how best to expand trade with the region and whether to      partner with China, at the center of the continent, or Japan, looking      toward the Pacific. Where should the United States draw its defensive      line, and how should it export democratic principles? In a history that      spans the eighteenth century to the present, Michael J. Green follows the      development of U.S. strategic thinking toward East Asia, identifying      recurring themes in American statecraft that reflect the nation's      political philosophy and material realities. Drawing on archives,      interviews, and his own experience in the Pentagon and White House, Green      finds one overarching concern driving U.S. policy toward East Asia: a fear      that a rival power might use the Pacific to isolate and threaten the      United States and prevent the ocean from becoming a conduit for the      westward free flow of trade, values, and forward defense. <em>By More Than      Providence</em> works through these problems from the perspective of history's      major strategists and statesmen, from Thomas Jefferson to Alfred Thayer      Mahan and Henry Kissinger. It records the fate of their ideas as they      collided with the realities of the Far East and adds clarity to America's      stakes in the region, especially when compared with those of Europe and      the Middle East.&nbsp;</div>

<div><strong>Brad Glosserman &amp; Scott A. Snyder (2015)</strong></div>
</div><div>Japan and South Korea are Western-style democracies with open-market economies committed to the rule of law. They are also U.S. allies. Yet despite their shared interests, shared values, and geographic proximity, divergent national identities have driven a wedge between them. Drawing on decades of expertise, Brad Glosserman and Scott A. Snyder investigate the roots of this split and its ongoing threat to the region and the world. They isolate competing notions of national identity as the main obstacle to a productive partnership between Japan and South Korea. Through public opinion data, interviews, and years of observation, Glosserman and Snyder show how fundamentally incompatible, rapidly changing conceptions of national identity in Japan and South Korea -- and not struggles over power or structural issues -- have complicated territorial claims and international policy. Despite changes in the governments of both countries and concerted efforts by leading political figures to encourage US-ROK-Japan security cooperation, the Japan-South Korea relationship continues to be hobbled by history and its deep imprint on ideas of national identity. This book recommends bold, policy-oriented prescriptions for overcoming problems in Japan-South Korea relations and facilitating trilateral cooperation among these three Northeast Asian allies, recognizing the power of the public on issues of foreign policy, international relations, and the prospects for peace in Asia.&nbsp;<br></div></div>

<strong>M. A. Thomas (2015)</strong></div><div>In the poorest countries, such as Afghanistan, Haiti, and Mali, the United States has struggled to work with governments whose corruption and lack of capacity are increasingly seen to be the cause of instability and poverty. The development and security communities call for 'good governance' to improve the rule of law, democratic accountability, and the delivery of public goods and services. The United States and other rich liberal democracies insist that this is the only legitimate model of governance. Yet poor governments cannot afford to govern according to these ideals and instead are compelled to rely more heavily on older, cheaper strategies of holding power, such as patronage and repression. The unwillingness to admit that poor governments do and must govern differently has cost the United States and others inestimable blood and coin. Informed by years of fieldwork and drawing on practitioner work and academic scholarship in politics, economics, law, and history, this book explains the origins of poor governments in the formation of the modern state system and describes the way they govern. It argues that, surprisingly, the effort to stigmatize and criminalize the governance of the poor is both fruitless and destabilizing. The United States must pursue a more effective foreign policy to engage poor governments and acknowledge how they govern.&nbsp;<br></div><br> <strong><a style="color:blue;text-decoration:underline" shape="rect" href="http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?t=sou9zp8ab.0.0.kgxxqjcab.0&amp;id=preview&amp;r=3&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ciaonet.org%2Frecord%2F34186" alt="http://www.ciaonet.org/record/34186" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?t%3Dsou9zp8ab.0.0.kgxxqjcab.0%26id%3Dpreview%26r%3D3%26p%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.ciaonet.org%252Frecord%252F34186&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1515686880914000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHWzov7FtGowmMgTd5d2MIfNn89Kg">Dangerous Trade: Arms Exports, Human Rights, and International Reputation</a></strong><br><div><strong>Jennifer L. Erickson (2015)</strong><br></div><div>The United Nations' groundbreaking Arms Trade Treaty (ATT), which went into effect in 2014, sets legally binding standards to regulate global arms exports and reflects the growing concerns toward the significant role that small and major conventional arms play in perpetuating human rights violations, conflict, and societal instability worldwide. Many countries that once staunchly opposed shared export controls and their perceived threat to political and economic autonomy are now beginning to embrace numerous agreements, such as the ATT and the EU Code of Conduct. Jennifer L. Erickson explores the reasons top arms-exporting democracies have put aside past sovereignty, security, and economic worries in favor of humanitarian arms transfer controls, and she follows the early effects of this about-face on export practice. She begins with a brief history of failed arms export control initiatives and then tracks arms transfer trends over time. Pinpointing the normative shifts in the 1990s that put humanitarian arms control on the table, she reveals that these states committed to these policies out of concern for their international reputations. She also highlights how arms trade scandals threaten domestic reputations and thus help improve compliance. Using statistical data and interviews conducted in France, Germany, Belgium, the United Kingdom, and the United States, Erickson challenges existing IR theories of state behavior while providing insight into the role of reputation as a social mechanism and the importance of government transparency and accountability in generating compliance with new norms and rules.&nbsp;<br></div><br><div><strong><a style="color:blue;text-decoration:underline" shape="rect" href="http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?t=sou9zp8ab.0.0.kgxxqjcab.0&amp;id=preview&amp;r=3&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ciaonet.org%2Frecord%2F34189" alt="http://www.ciaonet.org/record/34189" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?t%3Dsou9zp8ab.0.0.kgxxqjcab.0%26id%3Dpreview%26r%3D3%26p%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.ciaonet.org%252Frecord%252F34189&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1515686880914000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHFjwmsQsfCvHa6ep7rCeGCcBf6jg">Voices of the Arab Spring: Personal Stories from the Arab Revolutions</a></strong><br></div><div><a shape="rect"><strong>Asaad Al-Saleh (2015)</strong><br></a></div><div><a shape="rect">Narrated by dozens of activists and everyday individuals, this book documents the unprecedented events that led to the collapse of dictatorial regimes in Tunisia, Egypt, Libya, and Yemen. Beginning in 2011, these stories offer unique access to the message that inspired citizens to act, their experiences during revolt, and the lessons they learned from some of the most dramatic changes and appalling events to occur in the history of the Arab world. The riveting, revealing, and sometimes heartbreaking stories in this volume also include voices from Syria. Featuring participants from a variety of social and educational backgrounds and political commitments, these personal stories of action represent the Arab Spring's united and broad social movements, collective identities, and youthful character. For years, the volume's participants lived under regimes that brutally suppressed free expression and protest. Their testimony speaks to the multifaceted emotional, psychological, and cultural factors that motivated citizens to join together to struggle against their oppressors.&nbsp;<br></a></div><div><a shape="rect"><br></a></div><div><strong><a style="color:blue;text-decoration:underline" shape="rect" href="http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?t=sou9zp8ab.0.0.kgxxqjcab.0&amp;id=preview&amp;r=3&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ciaonet.org%2Frecord%2F34190" alt="http://www.ciaonet.org/record/34190" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?t%3Dsou9zp8ab.0.0.kgxxqjcab.0%26id%3Dpreview%26r%3D3%26p%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.ciaonet.org%252Frecord%252F34190&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1515686880914000&amp;usg=AFQjCNG-b-N-oU7ncsCGT9pqG19KQw2n-Q">Faces of Power: Constancy and Change in United States Foreign Policy from Truman to Obama</a></strong><br></div><div><span><a shape="rect"><span><strong>Seyom Brown (2015)</strong><br></span></a></span></div><div><span><a shape="rect"><span><span>This authoritative account of U.S. foreign policy from the end of the Second World War to the present challenges common assumptions about American presidents and their struggle with power and purpose. Brown shows Truman to be more anguished than he publicly revealed about the use of the atomic bomb; Eisenhower and George W. Bush to be more immersed in the details of policy formulation and implementation than generally believed; Reagan to be more invested in changing his worldview while in office than any previous president; and Obama to have modeled his military exit from Iraq and Afghanistan more closely to Nixon and Kissinger's exit strategy from Vietnam than he would like to admit. Brown's analyses of Obama's policies for countering terrorist threats at home and abroad, dealing with unprecedented upheavals in the Middle East, preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons, and containing new territorial expansion by China and Russia reinforce the book's 'constancy and change' theme, which shows that serving the interests of the most powerful country in the world transforms the Oval Office's occupant more than its occupant can transform the world.&nbsp;</span><br></span></a></span></div><div><span><a shape="rect"><span><br></span></a></span></div><div><strong><a style="color:blue;text-decoration:underline" shape="rect" href="http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?t=sou9zp8ab.0.0.kgxxqjcab.0&amp;id=preview&amp;r=3&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ciaonet.org%2Frecord%2F34284" alt="http://www.ciaonet.org/record/34284" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?t%3Dsou9zp8ab.0.0.kgxxqjcab.0%26id%3Dpreview%26r%3D3%26p%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.ciaonet.org%252Frecord%252F34284&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1515686880914000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEzM04Hk2t8Re5KG1zDZmi4Z9AHZQ">Counterinsurgency in Crisis: Britain and the Challenges of Modern Warfare</a></strong><br></div><div><span><a shape="rect"><span><strong>David H.

In their effort to apply the principles and doctrines of past campaigns, they failed to prevent Basra and Helmand from descending into lawlessness, criminality, and violence. By juxtaposing the deterioration of these situations against Britain's celebrated legacy of counterinsurgency, this investigation identifies both the contributions and limitations of traditional tactics in such settings, exposing a disconcerting gap between ambitions and resources, intent and commitment. Building upon this detailed account of the Basra and Helmand campaigns, David H. Ucko and Robert Egnell conduct an unprecedented assessment of British military institutional adaptation in response to operations gone awry. In calling attention to the enduring effectiveness of insurgent methods and the threat posed by undergoverned spaces, they underscore the need for military organizations to meet the irregular challenges of future wars in new ways.&nbsp;</span><br></span></a></span></div><div><span><a shape="rect"><span><br></span></a></span></div><div><strong><a style="color:blue;text-decoration:underline" shape="rect" href="http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?t=sou9zp8ab.0.0.kgxxqjcab.0&amp;id=preview&amp;r=3&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2FChoreographies+of+Shared+Sacred+Sites%3A+Religion%2C+Politics%2C+and+Conflict+Resolution" alt="http://Choreographies of Shared Sacred Sites: Religion, Politics, and Conflict Resolution" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?t%3Dsou9zp8ab.0.0.kgxxqjcab.0%26id%3Dpreview%26r%3D3%26p%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252FChoreographies%2Bof%2BShared%2BSacred%2BSites%253A%2BReligion%252C%2BPolitics%252C%2Band%2BConflict%2BResolution&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1515686880914000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEkdKe06nAfP4293OmLQCViCC0Dyg">Choreographies of Shared Sacred Sites: Religion, Politics, and Conflict Resolution</a></strong><br></div><div><strong><a shape="rect">Elazar Barkan &amp; Karen Barkey (eds) (2014)</a></strong></div><div><span><a shape="rect"><span><span>This anthology explores the dynamics of shared religious sites in Turkey, the Balkans, Palestine/Israel, Cyprus, and Algeria, indicating where local and national stakeholders maneuver between competition and cooperation, coexistence and conflict. Contributors probe the notion of coexistence and the logic that underlies centuries of 'sharing', exploring when and why sharing gets interrupted -- or not -- by conflict, and the policy consequences. These essays map the choreographies of shared sacred spaces within the framework of state-society relations, juxtaposing a site's political and religious features and exploring whether sharing or contestation is primarily religious or politically motivated. Although religion and politics are intertwined phenomena, the contributors to this volume understand the category of 'religion' and the 'political' as devices meant to distinguish between the theological and confessional aspects of religion and the political goals of groups. Their comparative approach better represents the transition in some cases of sites into places of hatred and violence, while in other instances they remain noncontroversial. The essays clearly delineate the religious and political factors that contribute to the context and causality of conflict at these sites and draw on history and anthropology to shed light on the often rapid switch from relative tolerance to distress to peace and calm.&nbsp;</span><br></span></a></span></div><div><span><a shape="rect"><span><br></span></a></span></div><div><strong><a style="color:blue;text-decoration:underline" shape="rect" href="http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?t=sou9zp8ab.0.0.kgxxqjcab.0&amp;id=preview&amp;r=3&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ciaonet.org%2Frecord%2F34192" alt="http://www.ciaonet.org/record/34192" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?t%3Dsou9zp8ab.0.0.kgxxqjcab.0%26id%3Dpreview%26r%3D3%26p%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.ciaonet.org%252Frecord%252F34192&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1515686880914000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEzFAOhFSusvK154taLiuZqJt9f3A">Schools for Conflict or for Peace in Afghanistan</a></strong><br></div><div><span><a shape="rect"><span><strong>Dana Burde (2014)</strong><br></span></a></span></div><div><span><a shape="rect"><span>Foreign-backed funding for education does not always stabilize a country and enhance its statebuilding efforts. Dana Burde shows how aid to education in Afghanistan bolstered conflict both deliberately in the 1980s through violence-infused, anti-Soviet curricula and inadvertently in the 2000s through misguided stabilization programs. She also reveals how dominant humanitarian models that determine what counts as appropriate aid have limited attention and resources toward education, in some cases fueling programs that undermine their goals. For education to promote peace in Afghanistan, Burde argues we must expand equal access to quality community-based education and support programs that increase girls' and boys' attendance at school. Referring to a recent U.S. effort that has produced strong results in these areas, Burde commends the program's efficient administration and good quality, and its neutral curriculum, which can reduce conflict and build peace in lasting ways. Drawing on up-to-date research on humanitarian education work amid conflict zones around the world and incorporating insights gleaned from extensive fieldwork in Afghanistan and Pakistan, Burde recalculates and improves a popular formula for peace.&nbsp;<strong><br></strong></span></a></span></div><div><span><a shape="rect"><span><strong><br></strong></span></a></span></div><div><strong><a style="color:blue;text-decoration:underline" shape="rect" href="http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?t=sou9zp8ab.0.0.kgxxqjcab.0&amp;id=preview&amp;r=3&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ciaonet.org%2Frecord%2F34193" alt="http://www.ciaonet.org/record/34193" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?t%3Dsou9zp8ab.0.0.kgxxqjcab.0%26id%3Dpreview%26r%3D3%26p%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.ciaonet.org%252Frecord%252F34193&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1515686880914000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEYhUSpZtjQWHmXbjmAUaoD44jXRw">The Arab Uprisings Explained: New Contentious Politics in the Middle East</a></strong></div><div><span><a shape="rect"><span><strong>Marc Lynch (ed.)

Who participated in those protests, and what did they hope to achieve? Why did some leaders fall in the face of popular mobilization while others found ways to survive? And what have been the lasting results of the contentious politics of 2011 and 2012? The Arab uprisings pose stark challenges to the political science of the Middle East, which for decades had focused upon the resilience of entrenched authoritarianism, the relative weakness of civil society, and what seemed to be the largely contained diffusion of new norms and ideas through new information technologies. In this volume, leading scholars in the field take a sharp look at the causes, dynamics, and effects of the Arab uprisings. Compiled by one of the foremost experts on Middle East politics and society, <em>The Arab Uprisings Explained</em> offers a fresh rethinking of established theories and presents a new framework through which scholars and general readers can better grasp the fast-developing events remaking the region. These essays not only advance the study of political science in the Middle East but also integrate the subject seamlessly into the wider political science literature. Deeply committed to the study of this region and working out the kinks of the discipline, the contributors to this volume help scholars and policymakers across the world approach this unprecedented historical period smartly and effectively.&nbsp;</span><br></span></a></span></div><div><span><a shape="rect"><span><br></span></a></span></div><div><strong><a style="color:blue;text-decoration:underline" shape="rect" href="http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?t=sou9zp8ab.0.0.kgxxqjcab.0&amp;id=preview&amp;r=3&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ciaonet.org%2Frecord%2F34194" alt="http://www.ciaonet.org/record/34194" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?t%3Dsou9zp8ab.0.0.kgxxqjcab.0%26id%3Dpreview%26r%3D3%26p%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.ciaonet.org%252Frecord%252F34194&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1515686880914000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGnPYT9FAwCYNU-6EgpSha18FHQuA">Shifting Sands: The United States in the Middle East</a></strong><br></div><div><strong><a shape="rect">Joel S. Migdal (2014)</a></strong></div><div><span><a shape="rect"><span><span>This volume revisits the approach U.S. officials have adopted toward the Middle East since World War II, which paid scant attention to tectonic shifts in the region. After the war, the United States did not restrict its strategic model to the Middle East. Beginning with Harry S. Truman, American presidents applied a uniform strategy rooted in the country's Cold War experience in Europe to regions across the globe, designed to project America into nearly every corner of the world while limiting costs and overreach. The approach was simple: find a local power that could play Great Britain's role in Europe after the war, sharing the burden of exercising power, and establish a security alliance along the lines of NATO. Yet regional changes following the creation of Israel, the Free Officers Coup in Egypt, the rise of Arab nationalism from 1948 to 1952, and, later, the Iranian Revolution and the Egypt-Israel peace treaty in 1979 complicated this project. Joel S. Migdal shows how insufficient attention to these key transformations led to a series of missteps and misconceptions in the twentieth century. With the Arab uprisings of 2009 through 2011 prompting another major shift, Migdal sees an opportunity for the United States to deploy a new, more workable strategy, and he concludes with a plan for gaining a stable foothold in the region.&nbsp;</span><br></span></a></span></div><div><span><a shape="rect"><span><br></span></a></span></div><div><strong><a style="color:blue;text-decoration:underline" shape="rect" href="http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?t=sou9zp8ab.0.0.kgxxqjcab.0&amp;id=preview&amp;r=3&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ciaonet.org%2Frecord%2F34195" alt="http://www.ciaonet.org/record/34195" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?t%3Dsou9zp8ab.0.0.kgxxqjcab.0%26id%3Dpreview%26r%3D3%26p%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.ciaonet.org%252Frecord%252F34195&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1515686880914000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFsj4PZKF57UO9Y9RRwOif3CwHpGQ">Under Siege: PLO Decisionmaking During the 1982 War</a></strong><br></div><div><span><a shape="rect"><span><strong>Rashid Khalidi (2014)</strong><br></span></a></span></div><div><span><a shape="rect"><span><span>This volume is Rashid Khalidi's firsthand account of the 1982 Lebanon War and the complex negotiations for the evacuation of the P.L.O. from Beirut.

The preface also cites recently declassified Israeli documents to offer surprising new revelations about the roles and responsibilities of both Israeli leaders and American diplomats in the tragic coda to the war, the Sabra and Shatila massacres.&nbsp;</span><br></span></a></span></div><div><span><a shape="rect"><span><br></span></a></span></div><div><strong><a style="color:blue;text-decoration:underline" shape="rect" href="http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?t=sou9zp8ab.0.0.kgxxqjcab.0&amp;id=preview&amp;r=3&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ciaonet.org%2Frecord%2F34278" alt="http://www.ciaonet.org/record/34278" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?t%3Dsou9zp8ab.0.0.kgxxqjcab.0%26id%3Dpreview%26r%3D3%26p%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.ciaonet.org%252Frecord%252F34278&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1515686880914000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGI11v0xn9GX94aWzKeyyPLBWEU7Q">Boundaries of Toleration</a></strong></div><div><span><a shape="rect"><span><strong>Charles Taylor &amp; Alfred Stepan (eds) (2014)</strong><br></span></a></span></div><div><span><a shape="rect"><span><span>How can people of diverse religious, ethnic, and linguistic allegiances and identities live together without committing violence, inflicting suffering, or oppressing each other?

Ira Katznelson follows with an intellectual history of toleration as a layered institution in the West. Charles Taylor advances a new approach to secularism in our multicultural world, and Akeel Bilgrami responds by offering context and caution to that approach. Nadia Urbinati explores why Cicero's humanist ideal of Concord was not used in response to religious discord. The volume concludes with a refutation of the claim that toleration was invented in the West. Rajeev Bhargava writes on Asoka's India, and Karen Barkey explores toleration within the Ottoman and Habsburg Empires.

Expanding a traditional vision of the institutions of representative democracy, Douglas A. Chalmers examines six aspects of political practice relating to the people being represented, the structure of those who make law and policy, and the links between those structures and the people. Chalmers concludes with a discussion of where successful reform needs to take place: we must pay attention to a democratic ordering of the constant reconfiguration of decision making patterns; we must recognize the crucial role of information in deliberation; and we must incorporate noncitizens and foreigners into the political system, even when they are not the principal beneficiaries.&nbsp;</span><br></span></a></span></div><div><span><a shape="rect"><span><br></span></a></span></div><div><strong><a style="color:blue;text-decoration:underline" shape="rect" href="http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?t=sou9zp8ab.0.0.kgxxqjcab.0&amp;id=preview&amp;r=3&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ciaonet.org%2Frecord%2F34290" alt="http://www.ciaonet.org/record/34290" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?t%3Dsou9zp8ab.0.0.kgxxqjcab.0%26id%3Dpreview%26r%3D3%26p%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.ciaonet.org%252Frecord%252F34290&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1515686880914000&amp;usg=AFQjCNH7PhZrFXBEkTj_pKMZq0sFdyiE-w">The Impossible State: Islam, Politics, and Modernity's Moral Predicament</a></strong></div><div><span><a shape="rect"><span><strong>Wael B. Hallaq (2014)</strong><br></span></a></span></div><div><span><a shape="rect"><span><span>This volume boldly argues that the 'Islamic state', judged by any standard definition of what the modern state represents, is both impossible and inherently self-contradictory. Comparing the legal, political, moral, and constitutional histories of premodern Islam and Euro-America, Wael B. Hallaq finds the adoption and practice of the modern state to be highly problematic for modern Muslims. He also critiques more expansively modernity's moral predicament, which renders impossible any project resting solely on ethical foundations. The modern state not only suffers from serious legal, political, and constitutional issues, Hallaq argues, but also, by its very nature, fashions a subject inconsistent with what it means to be, or to live as, a Muslim. By Islamic standards, the state's technologies of the self are severely lacking in moral substance, and today's Islamic state, as Hallaq shows, has done little to advance an acceptable form of genuine Shari'a governance. The Islamists' constitutional battles in Egypt and Pakistan, the Islamic legal and political failures of the Iranian Revolution, and similar disappointments underscore this fact. Nevertheless, the state remains the favored template of the Islamists and the <em>ulama</em> (Muslim clergymen). Providing Muslims with a path toward realizing the good life, Hallaq turns to the rich moral resources of Islamic history. Along the way, he proves political and other 'crises of Islam' are not unique to the Islamic world nor to the Muslim religion. These crises are integral to the modern condition of both East and West, and by acknowledging these parallels, Muslims can engage more productively with their Western counterparts.&nbsp;</span><br></span></a></span></div><div><span><a shape="rect"><span><br></span></a></span></div><div><strong><a style="color:blue;text-decoration:underline" shape="rect" href="http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?t=sou9zp8ab.0.0.kgxxqjcab.0&amp;id=preview&amp;r=3&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ciaonet.org%2Frecord%2F34294" alt="http://www.ciaonet.org/record/34294" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?t%3Dsou9zp8ab.0.0.kgxxqjcab.0%26id%3Dpreview%26r%3D3%26p%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.ciaonet.org%252Frecord%252F34294&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1515686880915000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFajC_nOjLisuRPrA7jIswIwvPi7g">The China Threat: Memories, Myths, and Realities in the 1950s</a></strong><br></div><div><span><a shape="rect"><span><strong>Nancy Bernkopf Tucker (2914)</strong><br></span></a></span></div><div><span><a shape="rect"><span><span>This volume confronts the coldest period of the Cold War -- the moment in which personality, American political culture, public opinion, and high politics came together to define the Eisenhower Administration's policy toward China. A sophisticated, multidimensional account based on prodigious, cutting-edge research, this volume convincingly portrays Eisenhower's private belief that close relations between the United States and the People's Republic of China were inevitable and that careful consideration of the PRC should constitute a critical part of American diplomacy. Nancy Bernkopf Tucker provocatively argues that the Eisenhower Administration's hostile rhetoric and tough actions toward China obscure the president's actual views. Behind the scenes, Eisenhower and his Secretary of State, John Foster Dulles, pursued a more nuanced approach, one better suited to China's specific challenges and the stabilization of the global community. Tucker deftly explores the contradictions between Eisenhower and his advisors' public and private positions. Her most powerful chapter centers on Eisenhower's recognition that rigid trade prohibitions would undermine the global postwar economic recovery and push China into a closer relationship with the Soviet Union. Ultimately, Tucker finds Eisenhower's strategic thinking on Europe and his fear of toxic, anticommunist domestic politics constrained his leadership, making a fundamental shift in U.S. policy toward China difficult if not impossible. Consequently, the president was unable to engage congress and the public effectively on China, ultimately failing to realize his own high standards as a leader.&nbsp;</span><br></span></a></span></div><div><span><a shape="rect"><span><br></span></a></span></div><div><strong><a style="color:blue;text-decoration:underline" shape="rect" href="http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?t=sou9zp8ab.0.0.kgxxqjcab.0&amp;id=preview&amp;r=3&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ciaonet.org%2Frecord%2F34297" alt="http://www.ciaonet.org/record/34297" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?t%3Dsou9zp8ab.0.0.kgxxqjcab.0%26id%3Dpreview%26r%3D3%26p%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.ciaonet.org%252Frecord%252F34297&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1515686880915000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGvLZY3bCxrz-_hjFKo6Pw_XmAl9w">Islam Through Western Eyes: From the Crusades to the War on Terrorism</a></strong><br></div><div><span><a shape="rect"><span><strong>Jonathan Lyons (2014)</strong><br></span></a></span></div><div><span><a shape="rect"><span><span>Despite the West's growing involvement in Muslim societies, conflicts, and cultures, its inability to understand or analyze the Islamic world threatens any prospect for East-West rapprochement. Impelled by one thousand years of anti-Muslim ideas and images, the West has failed to engage in any meaningful or productive way with the world of Islam. Formulated in the medieval halls of the Roman Curia and courts of the European Crusaders and perfected in the newsrooms of Fox News and CNN, this anti-Islamic discourse determines what can and cannot be said about Muslims and their religion, trapping the West in a dangerous, dead-end politics that it cannot afford. In <em>Islam Through Western Eyes</em>, Jonathan Lyons unpacks Western habits of thinking and writing about Islam, conducting a careful analysis of the West's grand totalizing narrative across one thousand years of history. He observes the discourse's corrosive effects on the social sciences, including sociology, politics, philosophy, theology, international relations, security studies, and human rights scholarship. He follows its influence on research, speeches, political strategy, and government policy, preventing the West from responding effectively to its most significant twenty-first-century challenges: the rise of Islamic power, the emergence of religious violence, and the growing tension between established social values and multicultural rights among Muslim immigrant populations. Through the intellectual 'archaeology' of Michel Foucault, Lyons reveals the workings of this discourse and its underlying impact on our social, intellectual, and political lives. He then addresses issues of deep concern to Western readers -- Islam and modernity, Islam and violence, and Islam and women -- and proposes new ways of thinking about the Western relationship to the Islamic world.&nbsp;</span><br></span></a></span></div><div><span><a shape="rect"><span><br></span></a></span></div><div><strong><a style="color:blue;text-decoration:underline" shape="rect" href="http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?t=sou9zp8ab.0.0.kgxxqjcab.0&amp;id=preview&amp;r=3&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ciaonet.org%2Frecord%2F34281" alt="http://www.ciaonet.org/record/34281" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?t%3Dsou9zp8ab.0.0.kgxxqjcab.0%26id%3Dpreview%26r%3D3%26p%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.ciaonet.org%252Frecord%252F34281&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1515686880915000&amp;usg=AFQjCNH-C_BtsfUEurJjSyr8tSgNYjMV7g">Nuclear Nightmares: Securing the World Before It Is Too Late</a></strong><br></div><div><span><a shape="rect"><span><strong>Joseph Cirincione (2013)</strong><br></span></a></span></div><div><span><a shape="rect"><span><span>There is a high risk that someone will use, by accident or design, one or more of the 17,000 nuclear weapons in the world today. Many thought such threats ended with the Cold War or that current policies can prevent or contain nuclear disaster. They are dead wrong -- these weapons, possessed by states large and small, stable and unstable, remain an ongoing nightmare. Joseph Cirincione surveys the best thinking and worst fears of experts specializing in nuclear warfare and assesses the efforts to reduce or eliminate these nuclear dangers. His book offers hope: in the 1960s, twenty-three states had nuclear weapons and research programs; today, only nine states have weapons. More countries have abandoned nuclear weapon programs than have developed them, and global arsenals are just one-quarter of what they were during the Cold War. Yet can these trends continue, or are we on the brink of a new arms race or, worse, nuclear war? A former member of Senator Obama's nuclear policy team, Cirincione helped shape the policies unveiled in Prague in 2009, and, as president of an organization intent on reducing nuclear threats, he operates at the center of debates on nuclear terrorism, new nuclear nations, and the risks of existing arsenals.&nbsp;</span><br></span></a></span></div><div><span><a shape="rect"><span><br></span></a></span></div><div><strong><a style="color:blue;text-decoration:underline" shape="rect" href="http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?t=sou9zp8ab.0.0.kgxxqjcab.0&amp;id=preview&amp;r=3&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ciaonet.org%2Frecord%2F34283" alt="http://www.ciaonet.org/record/34283" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?t%3Dsou9zp8ab.0.0.kgxxqjcab.0%26id%3Dpreview%26r%3D3%26p%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.ciaonet.org%252Frecord%252F34283&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1515686880915000&amp;usg=AFQjCNF46pyojogQHyir6dJGdYyGcCb46A">Security and Profit in China's Energy Policy: Hedging Against Risk</a></strong><br></div><div><span><a shape="rect"><span><strong>Øystein Tunsjø (2013)</strong><br></span></a></span></div><div><span><a shape="rect"><span><span>China has developed sophisticated hedging strategies to insure against risks in the international petroleum market. It has managed a growing net oil import gap and supply disruptions by maintaining a favorable energy mix, pursuing overseas equity oil production, building a state-owned tanker fleet and strategic petroleum reserve, establishing cross-border pipelines, and diversifying its energy resources and routes. Though it cannot be 'secured', China's energy security can be 'insured' by marrying government concern with commercial initiatives. This book comprehensively analyzes China's domestic, global, maritime, and continental petroleum strategies and policies, establishing a new theoretical framework that captures the interrelationship between security and profit. Arguing that hedging is central to China's energy-security policy, this volume links government concerns about security of supply to energy companies' search for profits, and by drawing important distinctions between threats and risks, peacetime and wartime contingencies, and pipeline and seaborne energy-supply routes, the study shifts scholarly focus away from securing and toward insuring an adequate oil supply and from controlling toward managing any disruptions to the sea lines of communication. The book is the most detailed and accurate look to date at how China has hedged its energy bets and how its behavior fits a hedging pattern.&nbsp;</span><br></span></a></span></div><div><span><a shape="rect"><span><br></span></a></span></div><div><strong><a style="color:blue;text-decoration:underline" shape="rect" href="http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?t=sou9zp8ab.0.0.kgxxqjcab.0&amp;id=preview&amp;r=3&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ciaonet.org%2Frecord%2F34286" alt="http://www.ciaonet.org/record/34286" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?t%3Dsou9zp8ab.0.0.kgxxqjcab.0%26id%3Dpreview%26r%3D3%26p%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.ciaonet.org%252Frecord%252F34286&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1515686880915000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHK5_JDO9ABtSXlvJjEzdMD6QAreA">Decoding Al-Qaeda's Strategy: The Deep Battle Against America</a></strong><br></div><div><span><a shape="rect"><span><strong>Michael W. S. Ryan (2013)</strong><br></span></a></span></div><div><span><a shape="rect"><span><span>By consulting the work of well-known and obscure al-Qaeda theoreticians, Michael W. S. Ryan finds jihadist terrorism strategy has more in common with the principles of Maoist guerrilla warfare than mainstream Islam. Encouraging strategists and researchers to devote greater attention to jihadi ideas rather than jihadist military operations, Ryan builds an effective framework for analyzing al-Qaeda's plans against America and constructs a compelling counternarrative to the West's supposed 'war on Islam'. Ryan examines the Salafist roots of al-Qaeda ideology and the contributions of its most famous founders, Osama Bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri, in a political-military context. He also reads the Arabic-language works of lesser-known theoreticians who have played an instrumental role in framing al-Qaeda's so-called war of the oppressed. These authors readily cite the guerrilla strategies of Mao, Che Guevara, and the mastermind of the Vietnam War, General Giap. They also incorporate the arguments of American theorists writing on 'fourth-generation warfare'. Through these texts, readers experience events as insiders see them, and by concentrating on the activities and pronouncements of al-Qaeda's thought leaders, especially in Yemen, they discern the direct link between al-Qaeda's tactics and trends in anti-U.S. terrorism. Ryan shows al-Qaeda's political-military strategy to be a revolutionary and largely secular departure from the classic Muslim conception of jihad, adding invaluable dimensions to the operational, psychological, and informational strategies already deployed by America's military in the region.&nbsp;</span><br></span></a></span></div><div><span><a shape="rect"><span><br></span></a></span></div><div><strong><a style="color:blue;text-decoration:underline" shape="rect" href="http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?t=sou9zp8ab.0.0.kgxxqjcab.0&amp;id=preview&amp;r=3&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ciaonet.org%2Frecord%2F34289" alt="http://www.ciaonet.org/record/34289" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?t%3Dsou9zp8ab.0.0.kgxxqjcab.0%26id%3Dpreview%26r%3D3%26p%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.ciaonet.org%252Frecord%252F34289&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1515686880915000&amp;usg=AFQjCNH2JFzIh8XGT4jRphyDf_RPOUu4JA">Tolerance, Democracy, and Sufis in Senegal</a></strong><br></div><div><span><a shape="rect"><span><strong>Mamadou Diouf (ed.)

Regional states must account for a more powerful potential adversary in China, and China has become more ambitious in its efforts to control its surroundings. Historical baggage has only aggravated the situation as China believes it is reclaiming its rightful place after a time of weakness and mistreatment, and other Asia-Pacific countries remember all too well their encounter with Chinese conflict and domination. Through a careful consideration of historical factors and raw data, Denny Roy examines the benefits and consequences of a more politically, economically, and militarily potent China. Since China's intended sphere of influence encroaches on the autonomy of regional states, its attempts to increase its own security have weakened the security of its neighbors. Nevertheless, there is little incentive for Beijing to change a status quo that is mostly good for China, and the PRC thrives through its participation in the global economy and multilateral institutions. Even so, Beijing remains extremely sensitive to challenges to the Chinese Communist Party's legitimacy and believes it is entitled to exercise influence on its periphery. On these issues, nationalism trumps any reluctance to upset the international system. Diplomatic disputes regarding the islands in the South China Sea, as well as controversial relations with North Korea, continue to undermine Chinese promises of positive behavior. Roy's study reveals the dynamics defining this volatile region, in which governments pursue China as an economic partner yet fear Beijing's power to set the rules of engagement.&nbsp;</span><br></span></a></span></div><div><span><a shape="rect"><span><br></span></a></span></div><div><strong><a style="color:blue;text-decoration:underline" shape="rect" href="http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?t=sou9zp8ab.0.0.kgxxqjcab.0&amp;id=preview&amp;r=3&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ciaonet.org%2Frecord%2F34298" alt="http://www.ciaonet.org/record/34298" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?t%3Dsou9zp8ab.0.0.kgxxqjcab.0%26id%3Dpreview%26r%3D3%26p%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.ciaonet.org%252Frecord%252F34298&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1515686880915000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEN_RCbbkOPIZTrr29tfeaSuHMdOg">Contemporary Japanese Politics: Institutional Changes and Power Shifts</a></strong><br></div><div><span><a shape="rect"><span><strong>Tomohito Shinoda (2013)</strong><br></span></a></span></div><div><span><a shape="rect"><span><span>Decentralized policymaking power in Japan had developed under the reign of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), yet in the1990s, institutional changes fundamentally altered Japan's political landscape.

To better understand these emerging dynamics, James Clay Moltz conducts the first in-depth policy analysis of Asia's fourteen leading space programs, concentrating especially on developments in China, Japan, India, and South Korea. Moltz isolates the domestic motivations driving Asia's space actors, revisiting critical events such as China's 2007 anti-satellite weapons test and manned flights, Japan's successful Kaguya lunar mission and Kibo module for the International Space Station (ISS), India's Chandrayaan lunar mission, and South Korea's astronaut visit to the ISS, along with plans to establish independent space-launch capability. He investigates these nations' divergent space goals and their tendency to focus on national solutions and self-reliance rather than region-wide cooperation and multilateral initiatives. He concludes with recommendations for improved intra-Asian space cooperation and regional conflict prevention. Moltz also considers America's efforts to engage Asia's space programs in joint activities and the prospects for future U.S. space leadership. He extends his analysis to the relationship between space programs and economic development in Australia, Indonesia, Malaysia, North Korea, Pakistan, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam, making this a key text for international relations and Asian studies scholars.&nbsp;</span><br></span></a></span></div><div><span><a shape="rect"><span><br></span></a></span></div><div><strong><a style="color:blue;text-decoration:underline" shape="rect" href="http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?t=sou9zp8ab.0.0.kgxxqjcab.0&amp;id=preview&amp;r=3&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ciaonet.org%2Frecord%2F48843" alt="http://www.ciaonet.org/record/48843" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?t%3Dsou9zp8ab.0.0.kgxxqjcab.0%26id%3Dpreview%26r%3D3%26p%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.ciaonet.org%252Frecord%252F48843&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1515686880915000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEVVn4GM_mT5xbET4LkIguGWLF19g">East Asia Before the West: Five Centuries of Trade and Tribute</a></strong><br></div><div><span><a shape="rect"><span><strong>David C. Kang (2010)</strong><br></span></a></span></div><div><span><a shape="rect"><span><span>From the founding of the Ming dynasty in 1368 to the start of the Opium Wars in 1841, China has engaged in only two large-scale conflicts with its principal neighbors, Korea, Vietnam, and Japan. These four territorial and centralized states have otherwise fostered peaceful and long-lasting relationships with one another, and as they have grown more powerful, the atmosphere around them has stabilized. Focusing on the role of the 'tribute system' in maintaining stability in East Asia and fostering diplomatic and commercial exchange, David C. Kang contrasts this history against the example of Europe and the East Asian states' skirmishes with nomadic peoples to the north and west. Scholars tend to view Europe's experience as universal, but Kang upends this tradition, emphasizing East Asia's formal hierarchy as an international system with its own history and character. His approach not only recasts common understandings of East Asian relations but also defines a model that applies to other hegemonies outside of the European order.&nbsp;</span><br></span></a></span></div><div><span><a shape="rect"><span><br></span></a></span></div><div><strong><a style="color:blue;text-decoration:underline" shape="rect" href="http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?t=sou9zp8ab.0.0.kgxxqjcab.0&amp;id=preview&amp;r=3&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ciaonet.org%2Frecord%2F48844" alt="http://www.ciaonet.org/record/48844" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?t%3Dsou9zp8ab.0.0.kgxxqjcab.0%26id%3Dpreview%26r%3D3%26p%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.ciaonet.org%252Frecord%252F48844&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1515686880915000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEpD9qm0_SpMNT5dKCzeCoqPbUgVA">Inside the Red Box: North Korea's Post-totalitarian Politics</a></strong></div><div><span><a shape="rect"><span><strong>Patrick McEachern (2010)</strong><br></span></a></span></div><div><span><a shape="rect"><span><span>North Korea's institutional politics defy traditional political models, making the country's actions seem surprising or confusing when, in fact, they often conform to the regime's own logic. Drawing on recent materials, such as North Korean speeches, commentaries, and articles, Patrick McEachern, a specialist on North Korean affairs, reveals how the state's political institutions debate policy and inform and execute strategic-level decisions. Many scholars dismiss Kim Jong-Il's regime as a 'one-man dictatorship', calling him the 'last totalitarian leader', but McEachern identifies three major institutions that help maintain regime continuity: the cabinet, the military, and the party. These groups hold different institutional policy platforms and debate high-level policy options both before and after Kim and his senior leadership make their final call. This method of rule may challenge expectations, but North Korea does not follow a classically totalitarian, personalistic, or corporatist model. Rather than being monolithic, McEachern argues, the regime, emerging from the crises of the 1990s, rules differently today than it did under Kim's father, Kim Il Sung. The son is less powerful and pits institutions against one another in a strategy of divide and rule. His leadership is fundamentally different: it is 'post-totalitarian'. Authority may be centralized, but power remains diffuse. McEachern maps this process in great detail, supplying vital perspective on North Korea's reactive policy choices, which continue to bewilder the West.&nbsp;</span><br></span></a></span></div><div><span><a shape="rect"><span><br></span></a></span></div><div><strong><a style="color:blue;text-decoration:underline" shape="rect" href="http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?t=sou9zp8ab.0.0.kgxxqjcab.0&amp;id=preview&amp;r=3&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ciaonet.org%2Frecord%2F34291" alt="http://www.ciaonet.org/record/34291" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?t%3Dsou9zp8ab.0.0.kgxxqjcab.0%26id%3Dpreview%26r%3D3%26p%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.ciaonet.org%252Frecord%252F34291&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1515686880915000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFMs5kiHWB3LjM5vQGYZiJXPXSmMA">China Rising: Peace, Power, and Order in East Asia</a></strong><br></div><div><span><a shape="rect"><span><strong>David C. Kang (2009)</strong><br></span></a></span></div><div><span><a shape="rect"><span><span>Throughout the past three decades East Asia has seen more peace and stability than at any time since the Opium Wars of 1839-1841. During this period China has rapidly emerged as a major regional power, averaging over nine percent economic growth per year since the introduction of its market reforms in 1978. Foreign businesses have flocked to invest in China, and Chinese exports have begun to flood the world. China is modernizing its military, has joined numerous regional and international institutions, and plays an increasingly visible role in international politics. In response to this growth, other states in East Asia have moved to strengthen their military, economic, and diplomatic relations with China. But why have these countries accommodated rather than balanced China's rise? David C. Kang believes certain preferences and beliefs are responsible for maintaining stability in East Asia. Kang's research shows how East Asian states have grown closer to China, with little evidence that the region is rupturing. Rising powers present opportunities as well as threats, and the economic benefits and military threat China poses for its regional neighbors are both potentially huge; however, East Asian states see substantially more advantage than danger in China's rise, making the region more stable, not less. Furthermore, although East Asian states do not unequivocally welcome China in all areas, they are willing to defer judgment regarding what China wants and what its role in East Asia will become. They believe that a strong China stabilizes East Asia, while a weak China tempts other states to try to control the region. Many scholars downplay the role of ideas and suggest that a rising China will be a destabilizing force in the region, but Kang's provocative argument reveals the flaws in contemporary views of China and the international relations of East Asia and offers a new understanding of the importance of sound U.S. policy in the region.&nbsp;</span><br></span></a></span></div><div><span><a shape="rect"><span><br></span></a></span></div><div><strong><a style="color:blue;text-decoration:underline" shape="rect" href="http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?t=sou9zp8ab.0.0.kgxxqjcab.0&amp;id=preview&amp;r=3&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ciaonet.org%2Frecord%2F48842" alt="http://www.ciaonet.org/record/48842" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?t%3Dsou9zp8ab.0.0.kgxxqjcab.0%26id%3Dpreview%26r%3D3%26p%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.ciaonet.org%252Frecord%252F48842&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1515686880915000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHUj4KXgFuLtbYUYQZG22Pc7b_TwA">Dangerous Strait: The U.S.-Taiwan-China Crisis</a></strong></div><div><span><a shape="rect"><span><strong>Nancy Bernkopf Tucker (ed.)

In the area of security, contributors provide incisive critiques of Taiwan's incomplete military modernization, the strains in U.S.-Taiwan relations and their differing interpretations of China's intentions, and the misguided inclination to abandon Washington's traditional policy of strategic ambiguity.&nbsp;</span><br></span></a></span></div><div><span><a shape="rect"><span><br></span></a></span></div><div><strong><a style="color:blue;text-decoration:underline" shape="rect" href="http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?t=sou9zp8ab.0.0.kgxxqjcab.0&amp;id=preview&amp;r=3&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ciaonet.org%2Frecord%2F48845" alt="http://www.ciaonet.org/record/48845" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?t%3Dsou9zp8ab.0.0.kgxxqjcab.0%26id%3Dpreview%26r%3D3%26p%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.ciaonet.org%252Frecord%252F48845&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1515686880915000&amp;usg=AFQjCNH-NZvTJMnkMoEXgSZ9BoZVKKlwlA">Nuclear North Korea: A Debate on Engagement Strategies</a></strong></div><div><span><a shape="rect"><span><strong>Victor D. Cha &amp; David C. Kang (2005)</strong><br></span></a></span></div><div><span><a shape="rect"><span>The regime of Kim Jong-Il has been called 'mad', 'rogue', even, by the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, the equivalent of an 'unreformed serial killer'. Yet, despite the avalanche of television and print coverage of the Pyongyang government's violation of nuclear nonproliferation agreements and existing scholarly literature on North Korean policy and security, this critical issue remains mired in political punditry and often misleading sound bites. Victor D. Cha and David C. Kang step back from the daily newspaper coverage and cable news commentary and offer a reasoned, rational, and logical debate on the nature of the North Korean regime. Coming to the issues from different perspectives -- Kang believes the threat posed by Pyongyang has been inflated and endorses a more open approach, while Cha is more skeptical and advocates harsher measures -- the authors together have written an essential work of clear-eyed reflection and authoritative analysis. They refute a number of misconceptions and challenge much faulty thinking that surrounds the discussion of North Korea, particularly the idea that North Korea is an irrational nation. Cha and Kang contend that however provocative, even deplorable, the Pyongyang government's behavior may at times be, it is not incomprehensible or incoherent. Neither is it 'suicidal', they argue, although crisis conditions could escalate to a degree that provokes the North Korean regime to 'lash out' as the best and only policy, the unintended consequence of which are suicide and/or collapse. Further, the authors seek to fill the current scholarly and policy gap with a vision for a U.S.-South Korea alliance that is not simply premised on a North Korean threat, not simply derivative of Japan, and not eternally based on an older, 'Korean War generation' of supporters. This book uncovers the inherent logic of the politics of the Korean peninsula, presenting an indispensable context for a new policy of engagement. In an intelligent and trenchant debate, the authors look at the implications of a nuclear North Korea for East Asia and U.S. homeland security, rigorously assessing historical and current U.S. policy, and provide a workable framework for constructive policy that should be followed by the United States, Japan, and South Korea if engagement fails to stop North Korean nuclear proliferation.&nbsp;</span></a></span></div><div><span><a shape="rect"><span><br></span></a></span></div><div><em><a shape="rect">More to follow...</a></em></div></span></td>
